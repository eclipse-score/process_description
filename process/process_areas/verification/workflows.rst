.. workflow:: Create/Perform Unit Test
   :id: wf__verification__unit_test
   :status: valid
   :tags: implementation
   :responsible: rl__contributor
   :approved_by: rl__committer
   :supported_by: rl__safety_manager
   :input: wp__sw_implementation, wp__verification__plan
   :output: wp__verification__sw_unit_test

   Every Unit shall have at least one Unit Test. They verify the detailed design of the implementation.
   Unit tests are automatically executed as part of the CI after PR merge.
   In case of changes at inputs, the workflow need to be executed again as part of maintenance.
   Any contributor can create a component test and create a PR for it.
   During the review process the test cases will be approved by a committer.
   Committer and contributor need to differ.
   The actual :need:`rl__committer` of the implementation can also be the creator of the unit tests.
   Independence is achieved by different approver at PRs and by the :need:`wp__verification__module_ver_report`.

   The typical steps when creating a unit tests are:

   #. Check the detailed design of the component. Create a test for every interface of the unit
      showing at least every flow in dynamic diagrams.
   #. Follow the detailed design to the component requirements and test these requirements.
   #. Fill in the test attributes based on the previous steps and provide a description.
   #. Link the test against detailed design or component requirement.

   :has: doc_concept__verification__process, doc_getstrt__verification__process

   Component Integration test cases are based on component architecture and component requirements.
   They also cover the detailed design and integration of units forming a component.
   The integration testing of component architecture is optional in case a component is standalone
   and has no (sub-)components.
   Any contributor can create a component integration test and create a PR for it.
   During the review process the test cases will be approved by a committer.
   Committer and contributor need to differ.

   :output: wp__verification__plan
   :contains: gd_guidl__verification_guide, gd_temp__verification__plan
   :has: doc_concept__verification__process, doc_getstrt__verification__process

   The verification plan is created by :need:`rl__committer`. It clearly
   outlines all aspects of the verification activities, provide a roadmap for the verification
   efforts throughout the software development lifecycle. The plan should be dynamic and updated
   as needed throughout the project lifecycle by :need:`wf__verification__plan_maintain`.

.. workflow:: Maintain Verification Plan

   as needed throughout the project lifecycle, as verification activities may be impacted, by new
   requirements, architectural decisions, introduction of tools.

   Note that during the initial creation of the verification plan in :need:`wf__verification__plan`
   not every input down to component level may be available.
