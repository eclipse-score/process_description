# Feature and Process Status

Derives and updates the completion status table in
`process/standards/feature_and_process_status.rst` by querying the live eclipse-score GitHub repositories.

## When to Use

- Refresh the tracker table with current data
- After a sprint/release to check progress
- When a module team reports a deliverable is done

## RST File Structure

`feature_and_process_status.rst` consists of a file header followed by 5 Process Area sections. Each section has this exact pattern:

```rst
Process Area N — <Name>
***********************

<Description paragraph.>
<Work products line (optional).>
See :ref:`<workflow_ref>`.

.. rubric:: Process Status

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: compact-overview-table

   * - Process req. status
     - ISO 26262 std_req status
     - Req. verification status
   * -

       .. rst-class:: small-pie-cell

       .. needpie::
          :labels: Valid, Draft, Invalid, Other
          :colors: LimeGreen, Gold, LightCoral, LightGray

          type == 'gd_req' and is_external == False and status == 'valid' and '<tag>' in tags
          type == 'gd_req' and is_external == False and status == 'draft' and '<tag>' in tags
          type == 'gd_req' and is_external == False and status == 'invalid' and '<tag>' in tags
          type == 'gd_req' and is_external == False and status not in ['valid', 'draft', 'invalid'] and '<tag>' in tags
     -

       .. rst-class:: small-pie-cell

       .. needpie::
          :labels: Ok, Recommendation, Open, Action, Deviation, N/A, Other
          :colors: LimeGreen, LightBlue, Gold, Orange, LightCoral, LightGray, Silver
          :filter-func: needs_filters.std_req_status_for_area(<tag>)
     -

       .. rst-class:: small-pie-cell

       .. needpie::
          :labels: Automated, Waiting for automation, Inspection list, Other
          :colors: LimeGreen, Gold, LightBlue, LightGray
          :filter-func: needs_filters.area_verification_status(<tag>)

.. rubric:: Implementation status: 🔄 NN% (X/Y deliverables complete)

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :class: module-phase-tracker-table

   * - **Deliverable**
     - **Baselibs**
     - **Communication**
     - **Logging**
     - **Orchestrator**
     - **Persistency**
     - **Time**
     - **Config Mgmt**

   * - <Deliverable name>
     - <status>
     ...
```

**Important rules:**
- `.. needpie::` does **NOT** support a `:title:` option — omit it entirely (causes build errors)
- The pie chart table uses CSS class `compact-overview-table`; each cell needs `.. rst-class:: small-pie-cell` before its `.. needpie::`
- The module tracker table uses CSS class `module-phase-tracker-table`
- Both `.. rubric::` directives are plain inline text — NOT RST section headings
- The `.. rubric:: Implementation status:` line is computed (see Step 4 in Procedure) and placed directly before the module tracker table

| Process Area | sphinx-needs tag |
|---|---|
| PA 1 — Change Management | `change_management` |
| PA 2 — Requirements Engineering | `requirements_engineering` |
| PA 3 — Architecture Design | `architecture_design` |
| PA 4 — Implementation | `implementation` |
| PA 5 — Verification | `verification` |

The pie chart diagrams are computed live by sphinx-needs at build time — they **never need manual updates**. Only update the filter `<tag>` when adding a new Process Area.

## Modules and Repos

> **IMPORTANT**: Each module has its own dedicated repo in the `eclipse-score` GitHub org AND content in `eclipse-score/score`. **Always check BOTH** the module's own repo and `eclipse-score/score` when counting needs elements. Never rely on `eclipse-score/score` alone.

| Module | Own Repo (always check!) | Docs in `eclipse-score/score` |
|---|---|---|
| Baselibs | `eclipse-score/baselibs` (no sphinx-needs RST so far) | `docs/modules/baselibs/**`, `docs/features/baselibs/docs` |
| Communication | `eclipse-score/communication` (no sphinx-needs RST so far) | `docs/modules/communication/**`, `docs/features/communication/docs` |
| Logging | `eclipse-score/logging` (no sphinx-needs RST so far) | `docs/modules/logging/**`, `docs/features/analysis-infra/logging/docs` |
| Orchestrator | `eclipse-score/lifecycle` — has `docs/module/health_monitor/` with comp_req/comp_arc | `docs/modules/orchestrator/**`, `docs/features/orchestration` |
| Persistency | `eclipse-score/persistency` — has `docs/persistency/kvs/` with comp_req/comp_arc ✅ | `docs/features/persistency` |
| Time | `eclipse-score/inc_time` (no sphinx-needs RST so far) | `docs/features/time/docs` |
| Config Management | `eclipse-score/config_management` (no sphinx-needs RST so far) | `docs/features/configuration` |

**How to search all repos for a module:**
```python
for repo in ["eclipse-score/score", "eclipse-score/<module_own_repo>"]:
    files = [p for p in get_tree(repo) if p.endswith(".rst") and "<relevant_path>" in p]
    for f in files:
        v, t = count_needs_in_file(repo, f)
```

## Status Format

- **``✅ Available (valid/total)``** — Artifact complete and approved: **100% of needs elements are `valid`** (valid == total). Always add the count in parentheses for requirements and architecture rows.
- **``🔄 NN% (valid/total)``** — In Progress: at least one element is `valid` but not all. Always show count.
- **``❌ Open``** — Not started, not found, or 0% valid
- For binary rows (Code, SW Development Plan, Unit Tests, CR approved): no count needed, just ``✅ Available`` or ``❌ Open``

**Percentage calculation per deliverable:**
- **Feature Req / Feature Arch**: count individual needs elements (e.g. `.. feat_req::`, `.. feat_arc::`) inside the doc with `:status: valid`; `valid / total`; 100% (valid == total) → ✅ Available
- **Comp. Req / Comp. Arch**: count individual needs elements across all component docs; `valid / total`; 100% (valid == total) → ✅ Available
- **Req. Inspection / Arch. Inspection**: `valid / total` across all checklists (feature + component combined); 100% (valid == total) → ✅ Available
- **Detailed Design + Code / Impl. Inspection**: `valid / total` across all `chklst_impl_inspection.rst` / `chklst_dd_inspection.rst` files
- **Binary deliverables** (CR approved, SW Dev Plan, Unit Tests, Integration Tests, Verification Report): no percentage
- **Detailed Design + Code / Impl. Inspection**: `valid / total` across all `chklst_impl_inspection.rst` / `chklst_dd_inspection.rst` files
- **Binary deliverables** (CR approved, SW Dev Plan, Unit Tests, Integration Tests, Verification Report): no percentage

## Status Criteria (per Deliverable)

### Process Area 1 — CR approved
- **✅ Available**: A closed GitHub Issue with "Feature Request" or "Contribution Request" for the module exists in `eclipse-score/score`

- **🔄 In Progress**: checklists exist but not all are `valid`
- **❌ Open**: no architecture checklists found

### Process Area 4 — SW Development Plan
- **✅ Available**: `eclipse-score/score` contains `docs/platform_management_plan/software_development.rst` (project-wide)
- **❌ Open**: file absent

### Process Area 4 — Code
- **✅ Available**: source files (`.cpp`, `.h`, `.py`, `.rs` etc.) exist in the module's own repo outside of `docs/`
- **❌ Open**: no source files found
- **Check**: `gh api repos/eclipse-score/<repo>/git/trees/main?recursive=1 --jq '.tree[].path'` then filter for source extensions, exclude `docs/`
- **NOTE**: All currently active modules (Baselibs, Communication, Logging, Orchestrator, Persistency, Time, Config Mgmt) have source code → all ✅ Available

### Process Area 4 — Detailed Design
- **✅ Available**: 100% of formal design doc needs elements (`.. dd_sta::`, `.. dd_dyn::`, `.. comp_dd::` or similar) in `detailed_design/` folders have `:status: valid`
- **🔄 NN%**: design docs exist and at least one element is `valid` but not all are `valid`; show `valid / total` %
- **❌ Open**: no RST files with actual design directives found, OR all existing design elements have `:status: draft` (0% valid = same as not started)
- **DO NOT count `chklst_impl_inspection.rst`** — those are inspection checklists, not design documents
- **DO NOT count bare `.. document::` wrapper files** — these are placeholders, not actual design content
- **Search both `eclipse-score/score` and the module's own repo** for `detailed_design/` folders

### Process Area 4 — Impl. Inspection
- **✅ Available**: 100% of `chklst_impl_inspection.rst` / `chklst_dd_inspection.rst` files have `:status: valid`
- **🔄 In Progress**: checklists exist but not all are `valid`
- **❌ Open**: no impl inspection checklists found

- **❌ Open**: no test files found

### Process Area 5 — Comp. Integration Tests
- **✅ Available**: Source repo contains integration test source files (`.cpp`/`.py` with "integration" in path)
- **🔄 In Progress**: integration test CI workflow exists but no test source files
- **❌ Open**: no integration test artifacts

### Process Area 5 — Feature Integration Tests
- **🔄 In Progress**: `integration_test_scenarios` or `feature*test*` paths found in source repo
- **❌ Open**: none found

### Process Area 5 — Module Verification Report
- **✅ Available**: `verification/module_verification_report.rst` exists AND `:status: valid` **AND** the file contains actual verification data (test coverage lists, DFA results, static analysis results etc.) — not just section headings
- **🔄 In Progress**: file exists with `:status: draft`
- **❌ Open**: file does not exist, OR file is a template placeholder only (section headings with no content)
- **⚠ Consistency check**: A Module Verification Report can only be ✅ Available if all prerequisite Phase 5 deliverables (Unit Tests, Comp. Integration Tests, Feature Integration Tests) are also ✅ Available. If any prerequisite is ❌ Open, mark the report ❌ Open regardless of `:status:` in the file.
- **Known pitfall — Persistency**: `eclipse-score/persistency` has a `module_verification_report.rst` with `:status: valid` but it is an empty template. Feature Integration Tests are ❌ Open → report must be ❌ Open.

## Procedure

### Prerequisites
- `gh` CLI must be authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- Python 3.8+

### Steps

1. **Fetch the repo tree** for `eclipse-score/score` and module source repos:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/eclipse-score/score/git/trees/main?recursive=1 --jq '.tree[].path' > /tmp/tree_score.txt
   ```

2. **Count needs elements** in each requirements/architecture file using this pattern:
   ```python
   import re, base64, subprocess
   def count_needs_status(repo, path):
       content = base64.b64decode(
           subprocess.run(["gh", "api", f"repos/{repo}/contents/{path}",
                           "--jq", ".content"], capture_output=True, text=True).stdout.strip()
       ).decode()
       statuses = re.findall(r'^\s+:status:\s+(\w+)', content, re.MULTILINE)
       valid = sum(1 for s in statuses if s == 'valid')
       return valid, len(statuses)
   ```
   Aggregate `valid` and `total` across all files per deliverable.
   Percentage = `valid * 100 // total`. 100% (valid == total) → ✅ Available, else 🔄 NN%.

3. **Update the RST file** `process/standards/feature_and_process_status.rst`
   with the computed values.

4. **Compute the Implementation status per Process Area** and update the bold status line that appears directly before each table:
   - Count how many deliverable cells (across all modules × all deliverables in that Process Area) are `✅ Available`
   - `complete = number of ✅ Available cells`, `total = number of module × deliverable cells`
   - 100% → `✅ Available (total/total deliverables complete)`
   - >0% → `🔄 NN% (complete/total deliverables complete)`
   - 0% → `❌ Open (0/total deliverables complete)`
   - Format: `**Implementation status: 🔄 NN% (complete/total deliverables complete)**`
   - Binary rows (Code, SW Dev Plan, Unit Tests, CR): count each module cell as 1 deliverable
   - Do NOT include an Overall row inside the table — the status line is placed as plain text before the `.. list-table::` directive

5. **Adding a new module** — add a row to the Modules and Repos table above, define its `feature_path` and `docs_path`, then add a column to the tracker table.

## Interpretation Notes

### Artifacts vs. Checklists — Key Rule
- **Artifacts** (Feature Requirements, Component Requirements, Feature Architecture, Component Architecture, Detailed Design, Code): derive status by **directly inspecting the repos** — look for sphinx-needs elements or source files. Do NOT rely on checklist presence/status.
- **Inspection rows** (Req. Inspection, Arch. Inspection, Impl. Inspection): these rows describe the checklists themselves — report what is found in `chklst_*.rst` files (how many exist, valid vs. draft). Computed as `valid / total` checklist files.

### Additional Notes
- **Requirements/Architecture rows**: count individual needs elements (`:status:` fields inside `.. feat_req::`, `.. feat_arc::`, `.. comp_req::`, `.. comp_arc_sta::`, `.. comp_arc_dyn::`, `.. real_arc_int::`, etc.) — NOT the document-level `:status:` field.
- **Code row**: source files outside of `docs/` in the module's own repo. All active modules currently ✅ Available.
- **Detailed Design row**: actual design directives (`.. dd_sta::`, `.. dd_dyn::`) in `detailed_design/` folders — not `chklst_impl_inspection.rst`, not bare `.. document::` wrappers.
- The SW Development Plan check is project-wide (not per-module) because S-CORE uses a single platform management plan.
- Verification report `status: valid` requires Committer approval in the PR merge.
- **Template vs. real report**: A file with `:status: valid` can still be an empty template. When checking `module_verification_report.rst`, look for actual content (tables, coverage numbers, test results) beyond section headings. If only headings are present, treat as ❌ Open even if `:status: valid`.
- **Phase 5 consistency**: The Module Verification Report cannot be complete if any prerequisite (Unit Tests, Integration Tests) is missing.

## Limitations

- Cannot detect whether requirements have 100% test coverage (needs needs.json analysis)
- Cannot check if static analysis findings are cleared
- Feature integration tests heuristic is weak — manual verification recommended

Done Criteria
*************

A module is considered **complete** when all of the following are true:

#. All ``valid`` component requirements have **100% test coverage** (linked via ``FullyVerifies`` or ``PartiallyVerifies``).
#. All CI metadata checks pass (``TestType``, ``DerivationTechnique``, ``Description`` set on every test).
#. Static analysis has no open ``Critical`` or ``High`` findings.
#. The **Module Verification Report** (``wp__verification_module_ver_report``) is generated and approved by a Committer.
```
